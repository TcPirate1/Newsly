# Newsly

A website that collects articles from the most prominent news sites in NZ and gives brief descriptions while leading the reader to the original article.

A website that has my personal used feeds. Should also have a search bar to find articles from varying sites.

## Resources

- [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/sources) because it includes NZ in it's searches.
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [mySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
- [hcaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) for contact page

## Notes
- Do not install npm packages globally. Hopefully this avoids update errors.
- Add login and registration functionality later so people can modify their own.
- script in <head> tag is causing hydration error. Consider NextJS's [script component](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/script)
